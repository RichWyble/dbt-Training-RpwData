# dbt-Training-RpwData

This repository contains my personal dbt training journey. I'll be using **Snowflake** as the backend.

This is my second time going through the **dbt Fundamentals** and **Quickstart** courses â€” mostly because the dbt training assumes you'll follow the courses in the recommended order.

I didn't.

Instead, I took a shortcut path as suggested by others. It got me to a point where I was knowledgeable and productive, but now I want to understand more of the *why* and dig into the details.

Welcome to the world of instant gratification â€” and the era of no-code and AI. ðŸ¤”
