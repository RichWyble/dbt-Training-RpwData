# Quickstart for dbt Cloud and Snowflake

## [Load data](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/snowflake?step=3#load-data)

The data used here is stored as CSV files in a public S3 bucket and the following steps will guide you through how to prepare your Snowflake account for that data and upload it.

1. Create a new virtual warehouse, two new databases (one for raw data, the other for future dbt development), and two new schemas (one for jaffle_shop data, the other for stripe data).

	To do this, run these SQL commands by typing them into the Editor of your new Snowflake worksheet and clicking **Run** in the upper right corner of the UI:
	```
	create warehouse transforming;
	create database raw;
	create database analytics;
	create schema raw.jaffle_shop;
	create schema raw.stripe;
	```
2. In the `raw` database and `jaffle_shop` and `stripe` schemas, create three tables and load relevant data into them:

	- First, delete all contents (empty) in the Editor of the Snowflake worksheet. Then, run this SQL command to create the `customer` table:

		```
		create table raw.jaffle_shop.customers 
		( id integer,
		first_name varchar,
		last_name varchar
		);
		```

	- Delete all contents in the Editor, then run this command to load data into the `customer` table:
		```
		copy into raw.jaffle_shop.customers (id, first_name, last_name)
		from 's3://dbt-tutorial-public/jaffle_shop_customers.csv'
		file_format = (
			type = 'CSV'
			field_delimiter = ','
			skip_header = 1
			); 
		```
	- Delete all contents in the Editor (empty), then run this command to create the `orders` table:
		```
		create table raw.jaffle_shop.orders
		( id integer,
		user_id integer,
		order_date date,
		status varchar,
		_etl_loaded_at timestamp default current_timestamp
		);
		```
	- Delete all contents in the Editor, then run this command to load data into the `orders` table:
		```
		copy into raw.jaffle_shop.orders (id, user_id, order_date, status)
		from 's3://dbt-tutorial-public/jaffle_shop_orders.csv'
		file_format = (
			type = 'CSV'
			field_delimiter = ','
			skip_header = 1
			);
		```
	- Delete all contents in the Editor (empty), then run this command to create the `payment` table:
		```
		create table raw.stripe.payment 
		( id integer,
		orderid integer,
		paymentmethod varchar,
		status varchar,
		amount integer,
		created date,
		_batched_at timestamp default current_timestamp
		);
		```
	- Delete all contents in the Editor, then run this command to load data into the `payment` table:
		```
		copy into raw.stripe.payment (id, orderid, paymentmethod, status, amount, created)
		from 's3://dbt-tutorial-public/stripe_payments.csv'
		file_format = (
			type = 'CSV'
			field_delimiter = ','
			skip_header = 1
			);
		```
3. Verify that the data is loaded by running these SQL queries. Confirm that you can see output for each one.
	```
	select * from raw.jaffle_shop.customers;
	select * from raw.jaffle_shop.orders;
	select * from raw.stripe.payment;   
	```
